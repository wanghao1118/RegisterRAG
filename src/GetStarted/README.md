Register RAG provides a simple and highly customizable way to build a RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
pipeline for text generation tasks.

## üåü Features

- Highly customizable

  You can easily customize the RAG pipeline through the configuration file using the components we provide.

  It is also easy to add your own components to the pipeline. You can just inherit the base class and implement the necessary methods. Then, you should regist your component in the factory. That's it!

- Quick to set up

  ~~A python package is provided to help you set up the RAG pipeline quickly. You can install it through pip.~~(Under development)

  ~~A docker image is provided to help you set up the RAG pipeline quickly. You can pull it from the docker hub.~~(Under development)

- Fully supports asynchronous operations

  Register RAG is designed to support asynchronous operations. You can easily run multiple components in parallel.

## üöÄ Installation

Note: **Only** `from source` is available now. More installation methods will be provided in the future.

Please refer to the [Installation Guide](./InstallationGuide.md) for detailed instructions.
